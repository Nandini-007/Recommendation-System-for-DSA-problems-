https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/,English,4.9,1000,Trees,"Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.",Diameter of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/,English,7.5,6396,Trees," path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
