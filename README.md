# DSA Problem Recommendation Engine

This project is a recommendation engine designed to suggest Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems to users. The recommendation engine utilizes various algorithms and techniques to provide personalized recommendations based on the user's skill level, interests, and past performance. The goal of this project is to help users enhance their DSA skills and practice solving relevant problems.


## Features

- Personalized recommendations: The recommendation engine generates personalized problem recommendations based on the user's skill level and interests.
- Problem filtering: Users can filter the recommended problems based on specific criteria such as problem difficulty, topic, or data structure.
- User progress tracking: The engine tracks the user's progress and performance on solved problems to refine future recommendations.
- Problem details: The application provides detailed information about each recommended problem, including problem statement, input/output format, and sample test cases.
- User authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and save their progress and preferences.
